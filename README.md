### Gameplay:
Press M to start game by switch to play mode, destroy objects and a door opens. Moving in that room you can find a sphere which is on patrol mode by default. If you move close to the sphere it’ll follow you around until you manage to move away from it. It’ll return to normal state when you runaway from the sphere. Across the other half of the map you can find the pathfinding Goose which follows a path and then moves back along the same path.
